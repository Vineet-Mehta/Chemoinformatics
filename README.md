 **Identification of Highest Priority functional group in organic molecules**
 
 Input is Fourier Transform Infrared spectral image, which is resized to (224,224) pixels shape.
 
 In the code, the images are taken from a HDF5 file which contains the pixel information of all the images.
 
 Data can be collected from [Spectral Database for Organic Compounds](http://sdbs.db.aist.go.jp/sdbs/cgi-bin/cre_index.cgi)
 
 Sample image from SDBS of  : ![Image of 2-butanol](https://github.com/Vineet-Mehta/Chemoinformatics/blob/master/C4H10O.gif)
 
 After resizing, the input passed to CNN : ![Sample image of 2-butanol](https://github.com/Vineet-Mehta/Chemoinformatics/blob/master/sample_input.png)
